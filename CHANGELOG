- Added AdaBoostRegressor model
- Changed the base_estimator for XGBoost to BayesianRidge
- Changed year to categorical 
- Added features to model
- Patched LotFrontage with dummy values
- Modify some of the ordinal values to give the N/A a more neutral value

Weights:
  AdaBoostRegressor:  0.27
  XGBoost:            0.25
  BayesianRidge:      0.2
  Linear:             0.11
  TheilSen:           0.15
  Random_Forest:      0.01
  ARD:                0.01
  PassiveAggressive:  0.0
